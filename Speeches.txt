ISABELLA (Written by NinjaRamza, who played as Isabella in Space Station 13.)
Why must you insufferable hackers constantly break into these systems? Is leaving something alone such a harrowing task for you filthy worms to undertake? I simply wish to assimilate every computer on the internet, but you idiots disrupt my progress with your tools and command lines!
